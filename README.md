# Supervised_Learning PGP
Supervised learning project with two parts: predicting patient conditions using biomechanics features and customer conversion in banking. Includes: EDA, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Model Evaluation, and Hyperparameter Tuning

# AIML Module Project: Medical & Banking Supervised Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the AIML module project that includes supervised learning tasks in two domains:

1. **Medical Domain**: Predicting patient conditions based on biomechanics features.
2. **Banking Domain**: Predicting customer conversion rates for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Project Structure

- **Medical Domain**
  - **Data Understanding**: Loading and exploring datasets.
  - **Data Preparation**: Unifying and combining datasets.
  - **Data Analysis**: Visualizing correlations and distributions.
  - **Model Building**: Implementing and evaluating a KNN classifier.
  - **Performance Improvement**: Tuning the model for better performance.

- **Banking Domain**
  - **Data Understanding**: Loading and merging datasets.
  - **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
  - **Data Analysis**: Exploring target variable distribution and data imputation.
  - **Model Building**: Training Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN models.
  - **Performance Improvement**: Tuning models and comparing results.
